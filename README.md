# Library Book Management

This project is a **Library Book Management** system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage a list of books, with the following features:

- **Add Books:** Users can add books to the library by entering the book title.
- **Remove Books:** Each listed book has a "Remove" button, allowing users to delete it from the library.
- **Persistent Storage:** The application uses `localStorage` to store the list of books, ensuring the data persists even after a page refresh.
- **Real-time Updates:** The displayed book list updates instantly as books are added or removed.
- **Animated Background:** The application includes an animated particle background using **Particles.js**. The background adapts based on the user's system preferences using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query, providing a light or dark mode experience.
